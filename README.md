**Abstract**

WELCOME!! Oh my, look at you stumbling into my K\&R repository. This repository is dedicated to tracking my progress as I read through the ENTIRE K\&R textbook, you may be asking why what kind of sociopathic tendency is this?? Long story short is it's because I need to keep my mind busy.

An additional reason for this repository existing is for personal documentation purposes, as I like making notes and looking back at them because my intrusive thoughts sometimes ask me “hey do you even remember how to pass in 2D arrays as function arguments in C?” Yes these sudden thoughts pop up as I zone out while stacking shelves at my retail job during the day. Sad, I know, but it makes my head itchy, and where there is an itch, one must scratch it so this repository is my head scratching utensil if you will. 

Also, as an aspiring developer I show my respects to C, and some youtuber told me to man up and learn what pointers are and it made me feel less of a man not knowing what they are so here I Am. Jokes aside, hopefully these notes may help anyone that reads through the textbook and needs some extra perspective on what's written on the page, maybe expressed in different wording. Hopefully some of the solutions I write, although they may be flawed, may help give some direction to people who are stuck on a particular exercise in the book and need just a general idea on how to go about a problem. 

In this repository the file structure is as follows. I kept them self explanatory so its easy for my blunt and stubborn self to navigate.
